84Foodbar Restaurant Server. This code is for a Node. Backend with js, Express, and Mongo, JWT authentication, and Stripe for payments. So, lets talk about strengths vs areas to improve and user management and what it would take to update would better serve you (and in a more secure manner).

Code Strengths

Environment Variables: Sensitive information like DB_USER, DB_PASS and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY are stored in environment variables;

Role based Access Control (RBAC): Roles based verification, only admin can perform limited actions, good for security.

Token-based Authentication Token-based Authentication: JWT is used to add an authentication process to applications, where requests must be made with tokens to be verified before being fulfilled.

async/await for Asynchronous Operations: Enables non-blocking code, making the server responsive and efficient.  Room for Improvement + Improvements Suggested

Strengthening JWT Security

Token pain: This verifyToken middleware has a static expiry (it hardcoded it into the string '1h') If so, you might want to use a shorter expiry (e.g. 15-30 min) and a refresh token mechanism to counteract this.

JWT Error handling: Instead of always returning for "forbidden Access", provide error specific messages based on error (expired token, invalid token etc.) for debugging and user experience.

Better MiddleWare for Security

Rate limiting: Adding a rate limit (for example, using express-rate-limit) to limit the number of requests per IP address can help prevent brute-force attacks.

Validate User Input: Avoid attacks such as SQL injection by sanitizing user input using a library like express-validator.
User Role Update Logic
In the app. For patch('/users/admin/:id' ) route other than admin ensure under an authenticated admin update user role is only admin only. Have checks in place to avoid privilege escalation, as an attacker may try to interfere with the request payload.
Password Encryption & Storage
If you are dealing with passwords (i.e., in app. hash passwords before storing them in mongodb (for example, if you have an endpoint like post('/users')). use a secure algorithm, ideally bcrypt. Do not store passwords in the database in plaintext.
Secure Database Connection
Database Connection Management: Enable automatic reconnection strategies to deal with the database unavailable, and enable MongoDB client connection pool management.
Access Control: Allow only certain database users and specify their allowed IP addresses.
 Modularize the Code
Splitting the code into modules for routes, middlewares, and database connection helps in maintainability and scalability.
 Handling Errors More Effectively
Global Error Handling: Implement an error-handling middleware at the end of the route definitions to catch and respond to errors globally.
